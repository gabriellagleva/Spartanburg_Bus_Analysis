Hello, this is the code used to generate figures 3 and 4 for our analysis of Spartanburg's bus system.

Average parcel size was determined using RandomCordinateGenerator.py. A sample of 40 pseudorandomly choosen parcels can be found in ParcelArea.xlsx.

Code used to generate figures can be found in Figure 3 Generator and Figure 4 Generator
